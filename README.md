BlackBerry 10 Cascades App to read data from CAN bus via Arduino and to control Trucky

This APP will be used at MobileTechCon 2014 in Munich and EclipseCon 2014 in San Francisco

Using this app we can visualize the data tracked with RaspBerry Pi from Truck CAN-Bus.

Attention: This APP is only to demonstrate the data collected by CAN-Bus -
it's not a full featured APP following all the Cacsades Guide Lines !
A real-world app would need more dynamic Components and Error-handling code for Network Access

Hav Fun !
